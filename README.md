## Known Bugs
- Untested and unlikely to work in multiplayer and dedicated for now.

## Changelog

- Version 1.0.1
  - Added configuration support - requires reloading the save

- Version: 1.0.0
  - Implemented basic functionality for signs
  - Replaced vanilla values (0,1,5,10) with higher values (0,2,10,50)

## Roadmap

(In most likely order of tackling them)

- [ ] Configuration of sign brightness levels can happen in-game
- [ ] Dimmer lights - Allow setting lights lower than 10%, as sometimes this is still too bright
- [ ] Configure "light cones" emitting from regular lights, allowing them to be reduced or eliminated
- [ ] Sun / Moon Brightness Control - to make your day and nights brighter or darker
- [ ] Place a slider in sign menu to give more fine-control over sign emissiveness
- [ ] Test and resolve any multiplayer / dedicated server issues, including synchroniziation of settings
